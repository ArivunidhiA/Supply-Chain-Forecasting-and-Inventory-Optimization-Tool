# Supply Chain Forecasting and Inventory Optimization Tool 🚀

## Overview
This project implements a supply chain forecasting and inventory optimization system using Python, SQL, and data visualization tools. It's designed to help businesses predict demand, optimize inventory levels, and identify supply chain inefficiencies.

## Features
- 📊 Demand forecasting using time series analysis
- 📦 Inventory optimization
- 📈 Supply chain efficiency metrics
- 🔍 Interactive dashboards
- 💾 Database management

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- SQLite
- Tableau/Power BI (for visualization)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supply-chain-forecasting.git
cd supply-chain-forecasting
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Initialize the database:
```bash
sqlite3 database.db < sql/create_tables.sql
```

## Usage

### Running the Forecasting System
```python
python main.py
```
